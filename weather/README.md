# cli-weather

This project allows the user to input the city, the country and in which unit to display it ( Celsius or Fahrenheit ) in the terminal which then returns the temperature and the condition in that city.

## Getting Started

Instructions to get the project up and running on your system

### Prerequisites

First of all you need node.js installed on your system which allows you to use the command in the projects directory:

```
npm install
```

This command installs all the node modules that are listed in our package.json file which lists the dependencies of the project.

### How to use it

* 1) You have to specify the city, the country and the unit (C or F). For example :

```
npm start Paris France C
```

Also worth to note that the unit displayed by default is Celsius.

If there's any error it will be displayed in Red in the terminal.

* 2) With the help of the meow package we can display help using the command :

```
npm start --help
```
