# cli-weather

This project allows the user to input the city, the country and in which unit to display it ( Celsius or Fahrenheit ) in the terminal which then returns the temperature and the condition in that city.

## Getting Started

Instructions to get the project up and running on your system

### Prerequisites

First of all you need node.js installed on your system which allows you to use the command in the projects directory:

```
npm install
```

This command installs all the node modules that are listed in our package.json file which lists the dependencies of the project.

### How to use it

*1

You have to specify the city, the country and the unit (C or F). For example :

```
npm start Paris France C
```

Also worth to note that the unit displayed by default is Celsius.

If there's any error it will be displayed in Red in the terminal.

With the help of the meow package we can display help using the command :

```
npm start --help
```
